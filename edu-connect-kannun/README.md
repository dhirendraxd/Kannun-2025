# üéì AI-Powered University Recommendation Web App

## üìå Overview

This web app helps students find the **best universities and courses** based on their profile and documents.
The AI **only recommends universities listed in our database** (stored in Supabase) ‚Äî it never pulls random results from the internet.

**For Students:**

* Upload academic documents (degrees, CV, IELTS scores, etc.)
* Set preferences (location, fees range, program type)
* Get **AI-generated recommendations** from universities listed on our platform only

**For Universities:**

* Post course offerings, intake dates, fees, scholarships, and other perks
* Reach interested students directly through the platform

## ‚ö° How It Works

1. **Student Profile Creation**
   Student uploads documents and enters preferences.

2. **Database Query**
   Backend queries **Supabase** for matching universities based on filters (location, fees, course type).

3. **AI Processing**
   Gemini API is given **only the filtered university data** and the student profile.

   * AI ranks the best matches
   * AI outputs a clear recommendation list

4. **Output Display**
   Recommendations are shown in a clean, modern UI with university details.

## üîí Preventing AI Hallucinations

We ensure accuracy by:

* **Not** letting AI search online
* Only feeding AI the data retrieved from Supabase
* Adding explicit rules in the prompt:

  > "Recommend ONLY from the provided list. If no match is found, say 'No suitable match found.'"

## üì° Example AI Call

```javascript
const prompt = `
You are an AI assistant that recommends universities ONLY from the provided list.

Student details:
${JSON.stringify(studentProfile)}

Available universities:
${JSON.stringify(universities)}

Rules:
- Recommend ONLY from the list
- If no match, reply "No suitable match found"
`;

const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-pro" });
const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
console.log(result.response.text());
```

## üèÜ Hackathon Theme Alignment

**Theme:** *Reimagining Education: Accessible, Engaging & Future-Ready Learning*
This project empowers students to make informed decisions, connects them directly with universities, and leverages AI to simplify the complex process of higher education selection.

If you want, I can now add a **full working example** of Supabase ‚Üí Gemini AI ‚Üí Recommendations using dummy data so you can run it instantly and see it work. That would make testing super quick.
Would you like me to prepare that?
